1.If I don't make any arguments, the cd command will print nothing.(However, if you have cd to a new path, a separate cd will return to the /home path.)
2.If I give cd command a path to a directory, it will move the default path to that directory.
3.If you use cd to go to a file, it will say Not a directory
